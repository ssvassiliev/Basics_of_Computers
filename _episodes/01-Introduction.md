## File extensions.

- text files: doc, pdf, rtf, txt 
- system files: sys, cfg, dll, ini, tmp, ico
- video files: avi, mpg, wmf, flv, mp4, vob
- audio files: mp3, flac, alac, wav, pcm, ogg
- programming languages: c, f, R, py, java, m, jl
- internet-related files: html, css, cer

A file extension is a suffix added to the name of a file to indicate what type of data is stored in the file. A file extension comes after the period in a filename and is typically made up of three or four characters, however there is no strict convention about the length of file extension. They can be as short as one character (.c, .m, .f). 3-4 character extensions are simply convenient. They are not too long, easy to recognize and remember. At the same time they permit to describe a variety of data types such as txt, doc, png, pdf, csv etc. A filename can include multiple periods.  In most cases, the extension includes only the characters after the final period. 

There are exceptions, however, such as the extension .tar.gz. This extension indicates that the file contains a "tape archive" .tar data file which is compressed with gzip.  So to read such a file you need first to unzip it and then unpack the archive. 

An operating system might rely solely on the file extension to determine which application to use to open it, or it might also rely on metadata stored inside a file. Each OS varies in terms of how it uses extensions when matching files to applications and the degree to which it uses them. Windows, for example, relies heavily on file extensions and windows programs cannot open files without them.  Linux and MAC rely on extensions when they're available, but they typically permit to open files without extensions as long as you are using the right program.

If you have a file with an extension that is not recognized by OS, you can manually associate it with a program. 

Example - .ent associate with VS Code.



## Installing software:


Installing a program means configuring your computer so that it can run a specific program. In most cases it is impossible to use an application without first installing it. A piece of software is installed when all of its files are placed in a folder on your computer and an executable file is placed where OS can find it. The installation process of software is highly dependent on the operating system. To install the software, you will use the installation file you downloaded; however, the format will vary depending on your operating system.


To install software on Windows you will download the installation executable. This executable (.exe) file contains the tasks our computer must perform to install the software. To run the executable, click on the .exe file. Then follow the set-up instructions and answer the questions in the prompts regarding your desired installation features. 

On MAC you will download Disk Image File .dmg. This  
Windows - run setup program
MAC - copy image to Applications
Linux - use package manager or shell script  

### System requirements.
Now that we have discussed operating systems, let's discuss how to use them. When you want to use a piece of software that did not come with your compute you must install it. 

All computer software requires certain hardware components or other resources on a computer in order to function effectively. Most software vendors list minimal and recommended system requirements. The system requirements are usually viewed as guidelines rather than absolute rules.
Generally, system requirements indicate which computer configurations will be most suitable for a particular software. 

The most common requirements are the physical computer resources, such as Processor, Memory, GPU, Storage and Operating System

How to check if your computer meets a software's system requirements?
Windows:
- Task manager (Ctrl + Shift + Escape) or search for it. 
- "About" section
MAC: 
- Apple -> About this MAC, click "More info" if needed

## Downloading files

### Where is the file I just downloaded?

Files you've downloaded are automatically saved in the Downloads folder. In Windows this folder is usually located in C:\Users\Your_account\Downloads.
In MAC OS /Users/Your_account/Downloads
 
### Can I download files to different places?

Internet browsers allow you to specify where you want to download files.
To configure Chrome or Firefox navigate to "Settings" -> "Download". 

Here you can also configure browser to "Ask where to save each file before downloading"


## Trouble shooting techniques

1. Gather information
2. Identify the specific problem
3. Determine the most probable cause
4. Find and test a solution
5. Verify that the issue is resolved 

General Troubleshooting Tips:
- Note any error messages you encounter.
- The Google search engine works best when you search for specific information.
- Restarting the computer is a good thing to try.
- Be sure to install all available updates (OS, device drivers, software)
- Start your computer in Safe Mode.
- The last resort is to reinstall the operating system.

When computer and software issues arise, troubleshooting is a systematic, step-by-step approach to detecting and fixing the problem.

- When troubleshooting, the first step is gathering information on the issue, such as a behavior that is not desired or a lack of functionality expected. 

- Identify exactly what is it that your computer is not doing that you want, or what is it doing that you don't want?

- Think of possible causes for the problem and write them down.

- Identifying the source of your computer issue will make finding a solution easier. Make a list of things that could be causing the problem. The process of elimination may help you figure out what's wrong. One by one, test each item on the list starting with the most likely cause of the problem.

- Note any error messages you encounter. When your computer gives you an error message, make sure you write down as many details as you can. Using the Internet is a good place to start searching for a solution.  Other users may have encountered similar issues, and solutions are often posted online. Google's search engine is most effective when you search for specific details.   

- Write down your steps: Once you start troubleshooting, you may want to take a note of each step you take. This way, you'll be able to remember exactly what you've done and can avoid repeating the same mistakes. 

- Restart the computer. Restarting the computer is a good thing to try. This can solve a lot of basic issues you may experience with your computer.

## 2. Objectives
This lesson is intended to lead you through some basic computer concepts that will give you a better understanding of the computer. We will learn what is inside a computer and how it works, how to use and maintain a computer, and how to handle possible issues.

## 3. What is a computer?
In its original sense, the term "computer" referred to someone who performed mathematical calculations. In doing their jobs, human computers were supposed to follow fixed rules and they had no authority to alter them. The term was later applied to mechanical devices that replaced human computers.

Today a computer is a programmable device that  
- accepts data as input
- processes that data with a set of instructions (a program) 
- produces results as output
- stores the results for future use

## 4. What are the different types of computers? 
There are different types of computers:
- supercomputers
- mainframes
- minicomputers (servers, don't confuse with mini-PCs)
- microcomputers

![](../fig/compouter_types.png)

### Supercomputers
Supercomputers are unique facilities, providing exceptional computing power. The term is used to describe the fastest high-performance systems available at any given time. Computers of this type are primarily used for scientific and engineering work requiring extremely fast computations.

Currently the most powerful supercomputer is Frontier. The Frontier has achieved a performance of 1.102 exaFLOPS. One exaFLOP is a quintillion (10<sup>18</sup>) double precision floating point operations per second.

### Mainframes
Mainframes are a type of computers that generally are known for their large size, amount of storage, processing power and high level of reliability. Mainframes first appeared in the early 40s. Companies and governments use mainframes as central computers to carry out their day-to-day operations. Mainframes are primarily used for mission-critical applications requiring high volumes of data processing such as census, industry and consumer statistics, and enterprise resource planning. Most mainframes are built by IBM.

### Minicomputers (Midrange Servers)
Computers called minicomputers have many of the features and capabilities of mainframe computers, but are smaller. DEC introduced mini computers in 1965 as a smaller and inexpensive alternative to mainframes. The PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor) was the first mini computer. It is famous for being the computer most important in the creation of hacker culture. And history's first space shooter game Spacewar! featuring orbital mechanics around a gravitational star.

In recent years mini computers evolved into a midrange computers or midrange servers running business and scientific applications. Midrange computer is a loosely defined term for a computer system that is more powerful than a general-purpose personal computer but less powerful than a full-size mainframe computer.

### Microcomputers
A microcomputer is a small, personal computer that is typically used by only one person at a time.

    1. Intel Xeon
    2. AMD Epyc +
    3. IBM Power
    4. Apple M2

## 5. What components are required for a computer to function?
There are three components that every computer needs to function, regardless of its type:

1. Hardware
2. Operating system (it includes system software + device drivers)
3. Application software

### Computer Hardware 
Hardware is stuff you can touch as opposed to the software which is abstract and exists in a virtual world of computer code. Hardware is made of materials mostly metals and semiconductors. It includes various components that are required for a computer to run.

### Computer Software
Software, in its most general sense, is a set of instructions or programs instructing a computer to do specific tasks. All computer programs such as executable files, libraries, and scripts can be defined as software. Software is stored in computer memory and can not be physically touched.

Software consists of instructions that upon execution instruct hardware to perform tasks for which it was designed. At its lowest level an executable program is composed of machine language instructions specific to a particular processor. 

A machine language consists of groups of binary values describing processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example an instruction may change the value stored at the particular memory location inside the computer. This effect is not directly observable by the user. An instruction may also cause something appear on the display of the computer system. Such state change is visible for the user. The processor carries out instructions in the order they are provided unless it is instructed to jump to a different instruction or interrupted. 

There are two types of software: system software, also known as an operating system, and application software.

### Operating System
Operating system is designed to operate the computer hardware, to provide basic functionality and to provide a platform for running application software. Operating system is an essential collection of computer programs that manages resources and provides common services for other software. Operating systems are composed of system software and device drivers. Boot loaders, command line shells, device drivers and windows managers are core parts of operating systems. 

Device drivers are programs that controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each  device needs a corresponding device driver. Thus a computer needs multiple device drivers. Also, operating systems come with software designed to assist users in maintaining and caring for their computers. This software is referred to as utilities.

An operating system can be compared to the driver of a car. The driver might appear as if all he is doing is instructing the car where to go. However, in fact he is bringing in a variety of information from different parts of a vehicle. He is also taking in any information that is given to him, like a map, instructions for where to travel, and road signs that he encounters along the way. An operating system within a computer interacts with a variety of components inside it in the same way that a driver interacts with a car. An operating system acts as a middle man between users and the computer by creating an environment that allows them to interact with the computer as efficiently as possible.

### Application software and computing platforms
Application software uses the computer system to perform useful work or provide entertainment functions beyond the basic operation of the computer itself.

In order for a piece of application software to run, it requires an appropriate environment which is known as a platform. Platforms can refer to a variety of things depending on the context. The term platform may refer to hardware or to an operating system. A platform can also be a Web browser or other underlying application software such as the Java or QuickTime, for example. Computing platforms can be thought of as the stage on which computer programs can run.

As an example, operating systems run on hardware, so when it comes to operating systems, hardware is a platform. In the case of Office or Photoshop, they are both programs that run on an operating system. This means that their platform consists of the operating system and the underlying hardware combined. As a final example, Java applications only need the Java runtime environment to operate, which means they can be run on any computer regardless of its hardware and its operating system, as long as Java runtime is installed on it.

Despite the fact that a lot of things work across different platforms, some more involved programs, like video editing software or games, do not run well or do not work at all across all platforms.

Hardware and software require each other and neither can be used without another.
